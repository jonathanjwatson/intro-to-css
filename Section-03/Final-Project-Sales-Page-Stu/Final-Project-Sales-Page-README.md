# Final-Project-Sales-Page

This is your final project! We've covered: 

* Vanilla CSS
* How to style via: HTML tag, Class, Id, and inline
* How to separate your CSS into a separate stylesheet
* How to properly order your CSS to ensure it's not overwritten
* How to be more or less specific i.e. `div.my-class` or `.myclass div`
* How to use Chrome Developer Tools to inspect and make live changes
* Typography
* Color options
* Contrast and its impact on Accessability
* Buttons, Links, and their corresponding hover states
* Pseudoclasses
* Icons
* CSS Variables
* The Box Model
* Layout and Positioning
* Flexbox
* Breakpoints and Media Queries
* Bootstrap
* Animations

Now is the time to put all your CSS knowledge together! 

Your goal is to use Bootstrap to build a dedicated sales page. 

### This page MUST have:

1. A header
2. Three distinct sections, each with an image and a paragraph
3. A purchase section with three tiers

### The "purchase section" MUST have:

* Three "boxes" side-by-side. 
* It should compare the various tiers of product offerings along with a purchase button for each. 
* Highlight one of the tiers as "recommended" and style it differently.

I've provided three examples of this style in the assets directory for this activity.

### Your Sales Page MUST use a custom color scheme. 

You are welcome to generate your own, or you can use this recommendation:

* #383961
* #5F758E
* #DBDFAC
* #DB162F
* #3B1F2B

### Your Page MUST be responsive

### Your Page MUST use custom typography of your choice. 

#### Hint:
* I recommend you go with Google Fonts


## This is a BIG task!

I will be checking in with you along the way to give suggestions on how to get started. I recommend you break it down into manageable, bite-sized chunks. Start with the basic bootstrap components and modify them as necessary. Then tweak and customize individual sections. 

Use previous class activities and their Solved folders for reference.

You've got this!
