# What-Are-Breakpoints

Breakpoints are specific pixel widths at which CSS styling and webpage layout traditionally changes.

Most breakpoints are based on screen size:

- Small (phone)
- Medium (tablet)
- Large (desktop)
- Extra-large (4k displays)

There is no "set" pixel widths for these breakpoints, but here are some commnon pixel widths:

- 640px - Phone (some will still say 480px)
- 768px - Tablet
- 1024px - Desktop
- 1280px - 4k

The way we interact with these breakpoints is through media queries.

Media queries allow us to change the CSS based on the viewport of the current user.

1. Modify the provided HTML and add more breakpoints. Change the box color at each standard breakpoint.
