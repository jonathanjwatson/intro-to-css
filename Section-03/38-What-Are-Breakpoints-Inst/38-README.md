# What-Are-Breakpoints

Breakpoints are specific pixel widths at which CSS styling and webpage layout traditionally changes. 

Most breakpoints are based on screen size:

* Small (phone)
* Medium (tablet)
* Large (desktop)
* Extra-large (4k displays)

There is no "set" pixel widths for these breakpoints, but here are some commnon pixel widths: 

* 640px - Phone (some will still say 480px)
* 768px - Tablet
* 1024px - Desktop
* 1280px - 4k

The way we interact with these breakpoints is through media queries. 

Media queries allow us to change the CSS based on the viewport of the current user.
