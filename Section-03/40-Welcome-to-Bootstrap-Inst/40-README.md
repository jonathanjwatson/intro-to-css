# Welcome to Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a CSS Library originally developed by Twitter in 2010. It was released for the public in 2011 and since then has been one of the most popular CSS libraries. [Bootstrap History](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/about/history/).

## Library vs Framework

Some would argue that Bootstrap is, in fact, a Framework. That becuse of the built-in features and functionality (made possible by JavaScript) it moves beyond a simple library. 

We will primarily be using it's library of pre-defined CSS styles. 

## How to use Bootstrap

In order to use bootstrap, you will need to apply its styles via CDN link. (Note: You may also find it helpful to proactively add the JavaScript as well in order to maintain full functionality for elements like dropdowns, etc.)

You can start using Bootstrap as easily as copy/pasting their sample elements from their documentation. 

## Todo: 

1. Build a Bootstrap page with only copy/paste.
