# Google-Fonts

Rather than hosting our own font files, we can also use fonts served up by third parties. Google Fonts is one of the most common sources. 

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

## Todo: 
1. Using the Google Fonts provided, import several google fonts. 
2. Update the `/assets/css/styles.css` file where indicated. 
3. Be sure to use best practices when assigning your fonts.
