## Course Structure

In this course we will learn via three primary learning methods: 

1. I will describe a concept. 
2. I will demonstrate a concept. 
3. You will explore a concept with a hands-on activity. 

You will see multiple activity styles: 

1. I give you working HTML and CSS, you add or change something. 
2. I give you working HTML with classes and ids in the right locations, you add the corresponding css.
3. I give you working HTML. You come up with your own classes, ids, and CSS.
4. I give you nothing. You build your app from scratch however you want to.
