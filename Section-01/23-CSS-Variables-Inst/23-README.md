True or false: CSS is a programming language?

While people will argue about it, the fact is that CSS is constantly evolving. With CSS you can actually run basic math computations and even store variables. 

Variables are helpful for when you want to re-use certain values over and over again, while providing for the possibility those values might change.

For example: 

* Using CSS Variables would allow you to modify your site's theme quickly. 
* Using CSS Variables would allow the user to customize certain aspects of the site.
