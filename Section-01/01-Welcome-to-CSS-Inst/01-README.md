# 01-Welcome-to-CSS

CSS or Cascading Style Sheets was first released in the earliest days of the Web, 1996 [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS).

It took basic HTML and turned it into what we know today: a digital representation of people, companies, personalities, and style. 

CSS uses three standard levels to style HTML:

1. Tag level

`body`, `h1`, `p` are examples of this. 

2. Class level

More specific than html tags. These must be named by the user. Designed to be re-used.

3. IDs

More specific than classes. These must also be named by the user, BUT they are designed to be used only once.

## Questions: 

1. In the provided HTML/CSS, what type of styling is being used?
