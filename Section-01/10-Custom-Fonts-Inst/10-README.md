# Custom-Fonts

We are not limited to the small number of web fonts available to us. We can also serve our own. 

## Where to find downloadable fonts
[DaFont](https://www.dafont.com/) is one of my favorite locations.

Remember, many fonts are licensed, meaning that if you use them on your site, it will require payment. 

## Questions: 
1. What are some downsides to using custom fonts? 
2. When using a custom font, what "best-practice" becomes SUPER important?
