# Dark Mode

Dark Mode is becoming more and more common. Today, we're going to create a dark mode for our Blueberry Juice sales page. The JavaScript that actually handles the class toggling has already been written for you. If you get done early, take a look at it and see how you could re-use or change it. 

## Todo: 

1. Style the page's dark mode appropriately. 


### Hints: 
1. Color variables have already been provided. 
2. Find the TODO section and think about all the things that might need to change.
