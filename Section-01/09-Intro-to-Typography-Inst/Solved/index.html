      <h1>HTML Headings and Paragraphs Example</h1>
      <p>
        This page demonstrates how to use all heading levels and paragraphs in
        HTML.

      <h2>Section 1: Main Heading Examples</h2>
      <p>
        In this section, you’ll see examples of headings ranging from level 1 to
        level 6. Headings are used to structure content in a meaningful
        hierarchy.
      </p>

      <h1>Heading 1: This is the main page heading</h1>
      <p>
        Typically used for the title of the page. It’s the most prominent
        heading on the page.
      </p>

      <h2>Heading 2: This is a section heading</h2>
      <p>
        This heading is typically used to introduce major sections within the
        content.
      </p>

      <h3>Heading 3: This is a subsection heading</h3>
      <p>Often used to introduce subsections or important subtopics.</p>

      <h4>Heading 4: This is a smaller subsection heading</h4>
      <p>Useful for breaking down sections further if needed.</p>

      <h5>Heading 5: This is a minor heading</h5>
      <p>Usually used for less important headings.</p>

      <h6>Heading 6: This is the smallest heading</h6>
      <p>Typically used for the least important headings in a document.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Section 2: Paragraph Examples</h2>
      <p>
        Paragraphs are used to contain text content in a logical, readable
        manner. They are represented with the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag in
        HTML.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here’s an example of a paragraph. Paragraphs can contain multiple
        sentences and are used for any block of text content. They are typically
        displayed with space between them to visually separate each block of
        content.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is another paragraph, demonstrating how text can be grouped and
        separated into meaningful sections. Multiple paragraphs can be used to
        structure content effectively.
