# More PseudoClasses

In Section 01, we looked at several [Pseudoclasses](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp). 

We specifically focused on the states that affect links and buttons. 

```
a:link {...}

a:visited {...}

button:hover {...}
```

However, there are numerous additional CSS pseudo classes available to us. 


## Todo:

1. Take a look at the link provided to W3 schools and see what other pseudoclasses are available to us. 
2. For as many as possible, answer the question, "When might we use this pseudoclass?"

## Hints:

These are some of the more common pseudoclasses you've probably seen in action.

* :first-child
* :nth-child(n)
* :valid
* :invalid
