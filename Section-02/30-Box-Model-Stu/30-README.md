# Box-Model

## Todo: 

1. Create an HTML page from scratch. 
2. Use the inspector tools and the box model to perfectly align it in the center of the page. 
3. Insert a picture onto the page. 
4. Add a border radius to the picture. 


## Questions:

1. What problems arise when trying to align something "perfectly" in the center?
2. How does the border relate to the padding of an element?
